    "Here we consider the *logistic map*, which illustrates how chaos can arise from a simple nonlinear equation.  The logistic map models the evolution of a population including reproduction and mortality (see Taylor section 12.9).\n",
    "\n",
    "The defining function for the logistic map is\n",
    "\n",
    "$ f_r(x) = r x (1-x) \\;, $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r$ is the control parameter analogous to $\\gamma$ for the damped, driven pendulum.  To study the pendulum, we looked at $\\phi(t)$ at $t_0$, $t_0 + \\tau$, $t_0 + 2\\tau$, and so on, where $\\tau$ is the driving frequency and we found $\\phi(t_0 + \\tau)$ from $\\phi(t_0)$ by solving the differential equation for the pendulum.  After transients had died off, we characterized the value of $\\gamma$ being considered by the periodicity of the $\\phi(t_n)$ values: period one (all the same), period two (alternating), chaotic (no repeats) and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here instead of a differential equation telling us how to generate a trajectory, we use $f_r(x)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{align}\n",
    "  x_1 = f_r(x_0) \\ \\rightarrow\\ x_2 = f_r(x_1) \\ \\rightarrow\\  x_3 = f_r(x_2) \\ \\rightarrow\\  \\ldots\n",
    "\\end{align}$\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be transients at the beginning, but this sequence of $x_i$ values may reach a point $x = x^*$ such that $f(x^*) = x^*$. We call this a *fixed point*.  If instead it ends up bouncing between two values of $x$, it is period two and we call it a two-cycle.  We can have a cascade of period doubling, as found for the damped, driven pendulum, leading to chaos, which is characterized by the mapping never repeating.  We can make a corresponding bifurcation diagram and identify Lyapunov exponents for each initial condition and $r$."
